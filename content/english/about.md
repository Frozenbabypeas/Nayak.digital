My name is Varun, a professional Manager in the retail industry, with over 8 years experience in leading teams.  I've always loved Information Technology since I can remember.  I've been working with computers since a very young age and currently learning to code.

<p>My goal for this website is to diarise my journey through Python and essential programming and showcase my projects along the way!</p>
